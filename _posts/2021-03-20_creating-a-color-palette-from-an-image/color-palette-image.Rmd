title: "Creating a color palette from an image"
description: |
  There are hundreds of color palettes in the R ecosystem, but sometimes we
  might want to use colors from a specific image. Here I show how to 
  use the `paletter` package to create a color palette for the 2020 Eucalypt of 
  the Year: the Western Australian Gimlet.

# Colors in R
Color palettes are important to people, and the R ecosystem includes literally 
hundreds of possible palettes. If you want a "complete" list, go and check out
Emil Hvitfeldt's list of palettes [here](https://github.com/EmilHvitfeldt/r-color-palettes);
but in practice there are only a few that we use routinely. Our default at ALA labs
is to use `viridis` for continuous scales, because (to quote their [CRAN page](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html)) it's color-blind friendly, 
perceptually uniform, and pretty. The default purple-green-yellow color scheme is lovely, but I'm 
a big fan of 'magma', which has a black-purple-orange-yellow scheme

```{r}
library(galah)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(viridis)

# Get field code for states/territories
search_fields("state") # layer: cl22 OR stateProvince

# Download record counts by state/territory
records <- galah_call() %>%
  galah_group_by(cl22) %>%
  atlas_counts()

# Add state information back to data frame
records$State <- factor(seq_len(nrow(records)), labels = records$cl22) 

# Plot
ggplot(records, aes(x = State, y = log10(count), fill = count)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_viridis(option = "magma", begin = 0.10, end = 0.95) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

My default for categorical color schemes is the 'dark2' palette from `RColorBrewer`;
but given the subject matter of our work, it's worth mentioning the wonderful 
`feather` package by [Shandiya Balasubramaniam](people/Balasubramaniam_Shandiya/index.html), 
which gives colors based on Australian bird plumage.

```{r}
# remotes::install_github(repo = "shandiya/feathers")
library(feathers)

rcfd <- galah_call() %>%
  galah_identify("Rose-crowned Fruit-Dove") %>%
  galah_group_by(cl22) %>%
  atlas_counts()
  
rcfd$State <- factor(seq_len(nrow(rcfd)), labels = rcfd$cl22) 

ggplot(rcfd, aes(x = State, y = log10(count), fill = State)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = get_pal("rose_crowned_fruit_dove")) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

```
All of this is fine, but what if you have a specific image that you want to take
colors from? A logical choice is to pick the colors you want using an image 
editting program, but if we want to try something automated, there are options
in R as well.

# Extracting colors

[National Eucalypt Day](https://www.eucalyptaustralia.org.au/national-eucalypt-day/national-eucalypt-day/) aims to raise awareness about Eucalypts and celebrate their influence on the lives of Australians. In honour of National Eucalypt day, we wanted 
to created a plot based on occurrences data held in the Atlas of Living Australia, 
themed using colours from actual Eucalypts.

We used this image from a tweet by Dean Nicolle:
  
```{r, echo = FALSE}
# remotes::install_github("gadenbuie/tweetrmd")
tweetrmd::tweet_embed("https://mobile.twitter.com/DeanNicolle1/status/1374112431782301698")
```

![Image of Eucalyptus salubris by Dean Nicolle](./data/Dean_Nicolle_Esalubris_image_small.jpeg)

First, get observations of the Eucalypt of the Year 2021 from ALA using the [galah](https://atlasoflivingaustralia.github.io/galah/index.html) package. Specifically, we use `atlas_counts()` to determine how many records of *Eucalyptus salubris* are held by the ALA:

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
n_records <- galah_call() %>%
  galah_identify("Eucalyptus salubris") %>%
  atlas_counts()
```

Here is what the data look like:

```{r}
n_records %>% head()
```


Then get a color scheme from images of the species in question using the [paletter](https://github.com/AndreaCirilloAC/paletter) package (which needs to be installed from GitHub) <br>

```{r, include = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
# remotes::install_github("AndreaCirilloAC/paletter")
library(paletter)

image_pal <- create_palette(
  image_path = "./data/Dean_Nicolle_Esalubris_image_small.jpeg",
  type_of_variable = "categorical",
  number_of_colors = 15)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# remotes::install_github("AndreaCirilloAC/paletter")
library(paletter)

image_pal <- create_palette(
  image_path = "./data/Dean_Nicolle_Esalubris_image_small.jpeg",
  type_of_variable = "categorical",
  number_of_colors = 15)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
scales::show_col(image_pal)
```
Note that we downsized the image before running the `paletter` code, as large images
take much longer to process.

# Creating a plot

Once we have this palette, the obvious question is what kind of plot to draw. We
could have done a map, but those can be a bit boring. We decided to try something
that represented the number of observations we had of this species at ALA, and 
included color, but was otherwise just a pretty picture that didn't need to contain
any further information. Rather than have a traditional x and y axis, therefore,
we decided to try out the [igraph](https://igraph.org/r/) package to plot the points
in an interesting way.

First, we create a vector containing as many points as we want to display, and 
distribute our colors among them as evenly as possible

```{r}
# create a vector to index colours
colour_index <- rep(seq_along(image_pal),
  each = floor(n_records / length(image_pal)))
# correct rounding errors
colour_index <- c(colour_index,
  rep(length(image_pal), n_records - length(colour_index)))

```

Then we can create a network using `igraph`, and use it to create a layout for 
our points

```{r}
library(igraph)

graph_list <- lapply(c(1:15), function(a){
  lookup <- which(colour_index == a)
  return(data.frame(
    from = lookup[c(1:(length(lookup)-1))],
    to = lookup[c(2:length(lookup))]))
  })
graph_df <- as.matrix(do.call(rbind, graph_list))         # build matrix
colour_graph <- graph_from_edgelist(graph_df)             # create network graph

# convert to a set of point locations
test_layout <- as.data.frame(layout_nicely(colour_graph)) # convert to df
colnames(test_layout) <- c("x", "y")                      # change colnames
test_layout$colour_index <- factor(colour_index)          # add colour_index col
```

Finally, we draw the plot with [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), removing
axes with `theme_void()`

```{r, layout = "l-body-outset", preview = TRUE}
ggplot(test_layout, aes(x = x, y = y, colour = colour_index)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.9) +
  scale_color_manual(values = image_pal) +
  coord_fixed() +
  theme_void() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}

# save
ggsave("plot_image.pdf", p)
```

That's it! While I like the effect here, I think the `paletter` package is best
suited to cases where there are large areas of strongly contrasting colors;
it's less ideal for images with subtle color differences. It also
doesn't appear to have been updated lately, which may mean it's not being supported
any more. But I'm happy with this plot, and would definitely consider using it 
again.
