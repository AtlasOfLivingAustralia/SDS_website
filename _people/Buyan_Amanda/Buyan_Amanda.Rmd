Here we show a simple method to quantify the bias of roads, cities, rivers and airports on species observations of legless lizards in the Northern Territory</em><br><br>

Here, we demonstrate this by creating a choropleth map to represent the density of plant records from the ALA across bioregions in Australia, and add multiple colour scales to differentiate marine and terrestrial records</em><br><br>

Here, we show how to make 3D plots in R with the `rayshader` package by visualising the number of species identified from ALA observations since 2020</em><br><br>
