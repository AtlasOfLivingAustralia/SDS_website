Here we show a simple method to quantify the bias of roads, cities, rivers and airports on species observations of legless lizards in the Northern Territory</em><br><br>
<a href='https://labs.ala.org.au/posts/2022-05-23-ggnewscale/'>Multiple colour scales in choropleth maps with ggnewscale}</a><br><em>Using multiple colour scales can be a great way to visually differentiate between geographic categories on a map. Here, we demonstrate this by creating a choropleth map to represent the density of plant records from the ALA across bioregions in Australia, and add multiple colour scales to differentiate marine and terrestrial records</em><br><br>
<a href='https://labs.ala.org.au/posts/2022-05-17_3d-map/'>Download plant species data by hexagon to make a 3D hex map\n</a><br><em>Making plots eye-catching can be useful for science communication. Here, we show how to make 3D plots in R with the `rayshader` package by visualising the number of species identified from ALA observations since 2020</em><br><br>
