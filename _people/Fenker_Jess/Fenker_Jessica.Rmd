Jess is an evolutionary scientist based at Atlas of Living Australia, with a postdoc on species delimitation methods and PhD on diversification at micro/macro scales. She is also affiliated with the Division of Ecology and Evolution, ANU. Jess brings her experience in R to improve the readability, data standardisation and performance of EcoCommonsâ€™ platform ecological modelling algorithms. Jess is a strong advocate for diversity in STEMM.

Here we show a simple method to quantify the bias of roads, cities, rivers and airports on species observations of legless lizards in the Northern Territory</em><br><br>

Here, we demonstrate this by creating a choropleth map to represent the density of plant records from the ALA across bioregions in Australia, and add multiple colour scales to differentiate marine and terrestrial records</em><br><br>

Here, we show how to make 3D plots in R with the `rayshader` package by visualising the number of species identified from ALA observations since 2020</em><br><br>
