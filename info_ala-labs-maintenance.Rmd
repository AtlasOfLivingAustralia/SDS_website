# Installation

Install the `distill` package from CRAN:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("distill")
```

Clone this repository to a local directory.

# Build website

From the [Distill for R Markdown](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/website.html) website:

If you are using R Studio, you can use the **Build Website** button in the Build pane to generate the site. This pane appears next to the Environment, History and Connections panes. If you don't see a Build pane, go to **Tools** --> **Global Options** --> **Pane Appearance** and add a check-mark next to "Build" in the upper right box.  

When you build a website, the following things occur:

1. All of the Rmd and md files in the root website directory will be rendered into HTML. Note however that markdown files beginning with “_” are not rendered (this is a convention to designate files that are included by top level documents).

2. Blog posts will be copied into the `posts` sub-directory of the output directory and blog listing pages will be re-generated.

3. The generated HTML files and any supporting files (e.g. CSS and JavaScript) are copied into an output directory (`_site` by default).

The HTML files within the _site directory are now ready to deploy as a standalone static website.

To build a website from the command line, use the `rmarkdown::render_site()` function:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
library(rmarkdown)
render_site()
```

Opening the `index.html` page in the `_site` folder will open the rendered site.

# Site customisation

See the [Distill website](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/website.html) page for instructions on website structure, editing and customisation.

## Adding Main Web Pages

Main web pages (ie. pages in the navigation bar) are saved in the top folder by their page name (for example, the content for the About page is in `about.Rmd`).

Additional pages can be added by creating a new R Markdown page in the main website folder with the yaml header:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
---
title: ""
description: |
  
output: 
  distill::distill_article:
    css: theme.css
---
```

Add pages to the website by adding them to the site navigation in `_site.yml` under `navbar`

## Site Output and Navigation

The `_site.yml` controls the main website information and site navigation.

Elements can be edited to alter navigation paths. For example, the `navbar` for the ALA Labs website is:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
---
navbar:
  logo:
    image: images/logos/ALA_Logo_Stacked_REV.png
    href: https://www.ala.org.au
  right:
    - text: "About"
      href: about.html
    - text: "Posts"
      href: posts.html
    - text: "Resources"
      menu:
        - text: "galah"
          href: galah.html
        - text: "ALA Labs Style Guide"
          href: test_style-guide.html

# Editing content

## Posts

### Writing new posts

Posts are written in R markdown. New posts should be created in the [AtlasofLivingAustralia/science Github repository](https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/science). Posts must be created using the correct Post template.

To create a new post:

1.  Create a new folder in the [comms folder within the AtlasofLivingAustralia/science Github repository](https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/science/tree/main/comms). If your new post is based on an existing R script already saved in a comms folder, navigate to the comms folder containing your R script

2.  Install the [alatheme](https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/alatheme) package

3.  Follow the instructions on [alatheme](https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/alatheme) to create a new ALA Website Post template in your working directory. Name your file the same name as your R script if your new Post is based on an existing R script


### Managing reproducibility with `renv`

The packages you use to make a post will inevitably change. At some point these changes will "break" your code and cause your post to stop knitting. When this happens, posts will become obsolete and impossible to update without updating/bug fixing the whole document. To stop this from happening, one can use the `renv` package to document and load the R environment + packages that were used to create a post on the date the post was finished. The ability to record a post's R environment makes it possible to reproduce R Markdown documents into the future.

Using `distill` and `renv` together can cause problems. Luckily, Danielle Navarro has created an (in progress) R package called `refinery` and a [blogpost on how she uses it with her own blog](https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2021-09-30_on-blogging-reproducibly/). Also see the `refinery` [GitHub repo](https://github.com/djnavarro/refinery) for more info.

Install the `refinery` package:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("djnavarro/refinery")
```


Here's a brief summary of the function used to manage posts:

  * When creating a new post, run `refinery::renv_new("folder-name-in-_posts-folder"` to make a "lock-file" for the blog in the _renv folder. This file documents the R environment of your post.

  * Add `refinery::renv_load("2021-04-14_hex-maps-for-species-occurrence-data")` at the top of the post to use the `renv` lock-file.
  
  * Manage the post's `renv` lock-file. Update the lock-file to what is saved in your local environment with `refinery::renv_snapshot()`. Update your local environment to what is saved in the lock-file with `refinery::renv_restore()`. Delete all `renv` infrastructure associated with a particular post (i.e., rage quit) with `refinery::delete`.
  
Read [section 4 of Dani's blogpost](https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2021-09-30_on-blogging-reproducibly/#step-4-updating-the-r-environment) to get an idea of how process works in more detail.


### Rendering posts

#### Writing your posts

Post Rmd files must be **Knit** into html files to be used on the website. When you **Knit** a document, R Studio renders the file starting with a blank slate - all packages and .Rdata must be loaded within the document, even if data or packages exist in your local environment. Rendering in this way improves the reproducibility of your document (though it can be frustrating at times). 

While writing your posts, you can render posts locally. If using R studio, you can render your Rmd file as an html by clicking the **Knit** button.

#### Prepaing your final post

When you are ready to publish your article, you should remove all personal information from your article and render your post using the code in `R/render_post.R`. 

Functions like `galah::galah_config()` + `atlas_occurrences()` require input or settings that are private (like your personal email address) that you shouldn't share in your final Rmd or html document. Using **Knit** will cause issues because R requires that this information is included in the document to render your R Markdown file.

`R/render_post.R` instead uses `rmarkdown::render()`, which preserves this information compared to using the **Knit** button in R Studio, and should render your R Markdown file correctly.

If your R Markdown renders successfully, the new html file will be saved in the file directory you set in `path`. Open this html file to view the rendered html page. 

### Adding new posts to the website

Once your post is ready to be added to the website, it's a good idea to double-check that the rendered html file of the post is the correct final version. New posts should be saved in a new folder within the `_posts` folder. Posts based on R script in the ALA/Science git repo should be named with the same folder name as in the Science repo

# Theme customisation

Distill uses a CSS framework that can be fully customised. CSS theme settings are in `theme.css`. See the [Distill website](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/website.html) page for instructions on how to edit additional website properties.

Some properties can be found in labeled sections, like settings for website fonts, header and footer sections. For example, website header settings can be found in the `.distill-site-header` section:

```{css, eval = FALSE}
/*-- WEBSITE HEADER + FOOTER --*/
/* These properties only apply to Distill sites and blogs  */

.distill-site-header {
  --title-size:       18px;    
  --text-color:       #ff414b; /* edited */
  --text-size:        15px;
  --hover-color:      #dd424c; /* edited */
  --bkgd-color:       #ffd8db; /* edited */
}
```

Other properties are edited using custom CSS.


## Editing custom CSS

Additional custom CSS is found in `theme.css`. Edit or create new CSS properties for html elements to customise the ALA Labs website theme.



## Custom html elements using R functions

`R/functions.R` contains functions that create html elements within the ALA Labs website. `R/functions.R` uses the [htmlTools](https://rstudio.github.io/htmltools/) package to write html code using R syntax. 

For example, the following R function and html code will both create a link of `class = "article-link"` which can be edited using CSS:

```{html, eval = FALSE}
<!-- html -->
<a class = "article-link" href = "https://ala.org.au/">my text</a>
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# R function
add_link_to_article <- function(title, url){
  tags$a(
    class = "article-link",
    href = url,
    "text"
  )
}

add_link_to_article(text = "my text", url = "https://ala.org.au/")
```


The benefits of writing R functions to create html elements are:

1.  Rather than trying to edit html elements that the Distill package runs in the back-end to build the website, adding html elements using R functions is easier and less prone to errors 

2.  It is easier for people familiar in R to reuse and edit the content of existing html elements created by R functions 

To use functions in the `R/functions.R` file on a website page or post, add the following code block below the YAML header

```{r, eval = FALSE}
``{r, include=FALSE}
library(htmltools)
source("R/functions.R")
``
```
