<!-- Main panel description -->

*I appreciate your colour matching of the flowers to the thumbnail/banner background. Very nice!*

::: paper-main-column
When habitat is broken up or fragmented, species find it harder to use their habitat effectively. Fragmenting is common in urban areas where roads and property can prevent species from crossing to other habitable areas, ultimately separating individuals and populations. When compared to larger, connected areas, fragmented areas have lower access to food, shelter and resources, and inhibit gene flow and genetic diversity.

*This bit feels like a separate point to those above. It's interesting, but I'm unconvinced it's important enough to include*[It is also important to consider that a species' unique traits or behaviour can also further how “connected” a landscape is (such as how mobile a species can be), not just how physically intact it is.]

Conservation managers and decision makers rely on a variety of expert information about habitat connectivity to make predictions ...*about what?*. Mapping and modelling connectivity can be complicated. While there has been an increase in accessible online resources that can help map habitat connectivity, they are often restricted within state jurisdictions *I don't think I know what this means. Are they private? Or can they not be applied outside of a specific area?*, limiting their broad utility.

Norman & Mackey (2024) used ALA data to help improve the precision of Australia-wide habitat connectivity maps for forests, and for select species: rainforest pigeons, gliding possums, glossy black cockatoos, and [name] black cockatoos*If you are going to write them out in parentheses anyway, might as well add them to the list. Also, are you calling them "black cockatoos" because they are non-specific in the paper? If not, maybe you can add the other common name?*. Maps were adjusted to consider movement fatigue between patches of forest, allowing clear, actionable prioritisation zones for conservation managers and decision makers. Doing so enabled the researchers to identify which connectivity pathways are beneficial for some species but not others.*This feels a little vague? Is there an useful example? Like whether removing road divisions helps...grasses or something? Might be overkill though, up to you whether you want to add*
