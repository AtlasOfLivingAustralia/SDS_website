When habitat is broken up or fragmented, species find it harder to use their habitat effectively. Fragmenting is common in urban areas where roads and property can prevent species from crossing to other habitable areas, ultimately separating individuals and populations. When compared to larger, connected areas, fragmented areas have lower access to food, shelter and resources, and inhibit gene flow and genetic diversity. 

Conservation managers and decision makers rely on a variety of expert information about habitat connectivity to make predictions about where species' might live, or have the ability to live in the future. Outside of whether a habitat is physically connected or not, there are also other variables like climate and geology that will determine habitat suitability. Different species may also have different requirements for habitat connectivity even if their preferred habitat is the same due to how comparatively mobile they are. For example, a bird is inherently more mobile compared to a mammal. 

Therefore, mapping and modelling connectivity can be complicated. While there has been an increase in accessible online resources that can help map habitat connectivity, they also tend to be within state services and jurisdictions, meaning that relevant conservation discussions and decisions risk becoming restricted within arbitrary markers. Habitat connectivity extends across state-borders, and therefore requires continent wide, cross-border initiatives for well informed and best practice conservation management. 

Under these concerns, Norman & Mackey (2024) used ALA data to help improve the precision of Australia-wide habitat connectivity maps for forests as a whole and for select forest-dwelling species in select regions: rainforest pigeons, gliding possums, glossy black cockatoos, and black cockatoos in Western Australia (Carnaby's, Baudins and red-tailed). Species specific maps were adjusted to consider movement fatigue between suitable patches (under a cost assumption that shorter connectivity routes are preferred), allowing clear, actionable prioritisation zones for conservation managers and decision makers to aid habitat connectivity for each species.
