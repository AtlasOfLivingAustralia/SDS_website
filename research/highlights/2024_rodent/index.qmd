Species range maps rarely provide historical context of where a species' habitat range was in the past. Without this context, it's easy to overlook that a species may have once lived in a greater geographic range in favour of a view that the species has only ever lived in its current, restricted habitat area. This "shifting baseline" view can make it difficult to identify and prioritise these now-restricted species for conservation decisions. 

Using species occurrence data retrieved from the Atlas of Living Australia’s [galah package](https://galah.ala.org.au), Species of National Environmental Significance (SNES) data, and subfossil records spanning from the literature, Smith and colleagues (2024) produced “restoration opportunity” distribution maps for Australian native rodents.  These maps intersected historically accessed areas with IBRA bioregions (i.e. regions that reflect ecological differences in communities and ecosystems), and were compared by overlaying current day distribution maps to identify whether each species' habitat has moved, contracted or stayed the same. 

Many rodent species were found to have differing historical and modern distributions, and overall, distorted perceptions of baseline habitats. This was the case for some rodents even categorised as “least concern” in the [IUCN Red List](https://www.iucnredlist.org), prompting researchers and managers to holistically consider factors contributing to their survival.
