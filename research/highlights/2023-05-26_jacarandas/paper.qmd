<!-- Main panel description -->

::: {.paper-main-column}
Pictures of species are a valuable way of documenting how traits and characteristics vary in different locations and over time.

To understand how shifts in climate are influencing seasonal behaviour of Australiaâ€™s plants and animals, Garcia-Rojas, Keatley & Roslan (2023) used images of Jacaranda trees (*Jacaranda mimosifolia*) to understand how their flowering patterns might have changed across time. Using data from a decade-long citizen science program along with data published to the Atlas of Living Australia, the authors used 11,578 Jacaranda sightings to calculate the time-period and intensity of flowering from [xx year] to [xx year]. 

Jacaranda's peak flowering was found to occur in December in Melbourne but in October in Perth and Sydney. [why does this matter? Is this bad or unexpected?] 

Flowering studies such as these can help us understand how a changing climate may impact important related factors such as the reproductive success of J. mimosifolia, and therefore its longevity.
