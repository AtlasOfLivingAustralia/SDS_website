<!-- I might suggest renaming the folder to `2024_freshwater-fish` or `2024_freshwater-fish-IUCN` just to be a little more specific for our own folder naming --> 
More than half of Australia's freshwater fish species are unique to Australia, found nowhere else in the world. This includes species like the ancient [Australian lungfish](https://bie.ala.org.au/species/https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/38a5a409-3f58-4522-acec-61444d999bd2#overview), the the [longnose sooty grunter](https://bie.ala.org.au/species/https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/9435389a-d9de-48ba-92a9-8302b6243654#overview), and the [spotted galaxias](https://bie.ala.org.au/species/https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/e4d85845-3e34-4112-90a9-f954176721ec) (pictured left). 

Despite this diversity, conserving freshwater fish in Australia has predominantly focused on addressing pest species and disturbed stream flows, which, while important, may not effectively manage *all* at-risk fish. This study provided the first comprehensive assessment of Australian freshwater fish extinction risk using the [IUCN Red List](https://www.iucnredlist.org/). 

Using current scientific literature and a combination of data from sources including the Atlas of Living Australia, Linterman et al. found that many Australian freshwater fish show signs that they are still in trouble, even if not formally recognized. Key threats affected introduced *and* native species (e.g., genetic diversity loss, disease, shifts to natural systems like streams). For almost half of the species listed they found that the only conservation action implemented was a noted occurrence in a protected conservation area. <!-- I don't understand how this is a conservation action? Maybe be a little more specific -->

In addition to the 63 freshwater fish species currently listed as at risk to extinction, this study identified a potential 35 more. Many of these potential species are already identified by the IUCN Red List <!-- ...but are not listed within National threatened species lists? -->. A further <!-- how many --> species were found suitable for an upgraded status (e.g., sensitive to threatened) but are not yet <!-- editing tip: you can always edit out "to be" (which I did here)--> reflected. The authors conclude that the current conservation effort for Australian freshwater fish may not align with the level threat. Australia may need to update their accepted assessment of risk urgently to prevent extinction of many Australian freshwater fish species.
