::: paper-main-column
There are ongoing debates surrounding the reliability of citizen science data in ecology. These usually involve questioning the viability of consistent long-term data collection and the overall accuracy of citizen science data. Some believe that citizen science data isn’t as viable as professionally collected data for ecological research, while others note that citizen science data can be utilised as long as it is filtered for erroneous records or is methodologically collected. 

Reviewing an over thirty-year citizen science project on water quality and biodiversity that contributes data to the ALA (WaterWatch ACT), O’Reilly et al.’s (2023) paper finds that citizen science data can be led astray from research-grade qualities simply through diverging objectives from academic science. In other words, poor quality data in this project was primarily found to stem from out of sync objectives – not from a lack of expertise from contributing citizen scientists. For example, one citizen science objective is often having an increased sense of data ownership which can be empowered by volunteers being able to choose their sites and record data at any time. This may also be more convenient for volunteers, both promoting more data collection from citizen scientists. However, this objective was largely responsible for creating fragmented sample sizes along their sites of interest, versus congregated long-term sample sizes. Large and long-term data sizes at calculated sites allow a more fair and unbiased comparison of data across time and space. 

Ultimately, this research is not to say that citizen science objectives are less important. They are valuable in promoting ecological data collection where professional collection may be lacking. Though, when amassing large quantities of data for research, data quality is integral. WaterWatch ACT were able to use this information to balance objectives and ultimately retain strong citizen science support and improve data quality at the same time.
