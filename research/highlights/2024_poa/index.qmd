Pollen does more than just fertilise plants - and sometimes - its' effects aren't always positive. Sinusitis, rhinitis,  asthma can all be allergy induced by pollen in the air. While generally considered comparatively mild diseases, each have a potential impact on human health; especially to those living in regions with high pollen counts. With the regularity they occur these diseases have substantial economic costs and disproportionately burden lower socioeconomic groups. Researching the spatial distribution of pollen or where it is predominantly coming from, at what times of the year, and how this may shift with localised weather and a changing climate, can help us understand how to manage the carry-on effects of living near and within vegetated areas. Van Haeftan et al. use airborne environmental DNA samples to assess what grass species are contributing to pollen levels in two Australian environments in the Brisbane area and Sydney area  (one tropical, one temperate). 

They use ALA data to further compare what areas within these localised regions have the highest concentration of the found dominant grass species. They found pollen levels to be distributed across the entire calendar year more so in outer Sydney (Richmond) than closer to the city (Macquarie Park). The opposite was found in Queensland, where pollen levels varied over the year closer to the city and less so outside in the south-west. From April-May, all regions had generally higher pollen counts. *Panicoideae* and *Chloridoideae* were the most commonly identified host plant subfamilies of pollen in Brisbane and Sydney. *Chloridoideae* was more common in Queensland and *Panicoideae* was more common in Sydney. Due to Queenslands' more varied local tropical climate, pollen distribution was more dynamic through time than it was in Sydney overall.
