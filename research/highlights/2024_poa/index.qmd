Pollen is essential for flowering plant reproduction, but that doesn't mean pollen is always welcomed by people with allergy-induced sinusitis, rhinitis, asthma. While generally considered mild diseases, their regularity incurs substantial economic costs that disproportionately affect lower socioeconomic groups <!-- This is cool but without context, it just makes me question why? Are lower socioeconomic groups more prone to allergies? Do they live in areas with more pollen? This might create more questions than answers. I don't think more context is necessary here, but pointing out that I'm confused haha -->. Researching the spatial distribution of pollen, where it originates, when it emerges, and how this shifts with changing climates, can help us understand how to manage the carry-on effects of living in areas with more pollen. 

Van Haeftan and colleagues use airborne environmental DNA samples to assess what grass species are contributing to pollen levels in two Australian environments in the Brisbane area and Sydney area. The authors used ALA data to further compare what areas within these localised regions have the highest concentration of identified grass species. 

They found that pollen counts were generally highest from April to May. The authors found pollen levels fluctuate across the entire calendar year, with more variable pollen levels in outer Sydney regions than closer to the city, whereas the opposite was true in Queensland. [*Panicoideae*](link to species page on ala) and [*Chloridoideae*](link to species page on ala) were the most commonly identified host plant subfamilies of pollen in Brisbane and Sydney. More variable local tropical climates (like in Queensland) lead pollen distribution was more dynamic through time than it was in Sydney overall.
