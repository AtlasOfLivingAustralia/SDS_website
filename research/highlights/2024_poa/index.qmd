::: paper-main-column

The Australian native weevil *Siraton internatus* has a (big!) appetite for ferns. These insects tunnel deep into a ferns root mantle, stem and leaves, causing slow dieback. Under the right conditions weevils can proliferate and infest ecosystems which can cause considerable damage to the health of native species. 

Like most organisms they have a preference for certain habitats and climates that are expected to move globally with climate change. While some species are able to adapt to a different climate with apt exposure, the likeliness of this happening is reduced the faster the rate to which a climatic change occurs. The movement of a potential pest species also comes with a geographic and socioeconomic shift in management responsibility. This responsbility may fall to groups who may not be adequately prepared or supported without sound knowledge of their possible movements.

Hsaio & Liao conduct use ALA occurrence data to test where *S. internatus* may move under four different climate change adaptation scenarios globally up until the year 2090. While their current known occurrence exists only in Australia, Europe and North America, this species has the potential to move globally with an enabling force of a changing climate or insufficient biosecurity. They find the Australian weevils' population to likely to contract from its' current range, however, preference will likely expand in Chile and within the southern Himalaya's. With this knowledge, managers and biosecurity teams can work to prepare for a potential invasion and reinforce measures specific to their environments.
