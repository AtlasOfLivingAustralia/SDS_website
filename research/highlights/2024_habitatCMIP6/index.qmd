::: {.paper-main-column}
It is increasingly important for us to understand where a shift in climate might change a species preferred place to live. With this knowledge, management decisions on where to allocate resources and efforts become more informed and, likely, more effective in preserving biodiversity. It is a nuanced phenomenon though, and climate isn’t something that can be considered alone in determining a species distribution. Climate functions in tandem with other finer scale factors, as far down to soil characteristics to a larger habitat quality – and has the capacity to change them too. 

This paper uses species occurrence data from the Atlas of Living Australia and combines them with environmental and climatic data to predict possible large-scale habitat preference changes under different climate scenarios. Individual species maps and tabled data are made openly available for researchers and managers to access, as well as an ensemble of all species to make general remarks on species possible movements through time. 

Substantial changes in distributions for many species are found, with the combined analysis pointing species to be generally moving away from coastal regions with the exception of south and south-west Australia. Adelaide and surrounding areas have the highest habitat suitability generally for the over 10,000 species included in the study.
