Australia's environment is vast and diverse. Many areas are difficult to survey ecologically. As our climate and environment shifts, figuring out where species might be, or might prefer to be into the future, becomes an increasingly pressing issue for scientists and resource managers. With knowledge on how this might play out management decisions on the prioritisation of national and state-level restoration initiatives become more informed and, likely, more effective in preserving biodiversity.  

This paper uses species occurrence data from the Atlas of Living Australia and combines it with environmental and climatic data to predict potential habitat suitability maps for over ten thousand species (individually and collectively) under different climate scenarios. These climate scenarios are based on varying levels of potential emission intensities and how they are projected to impact temperature. The resulting individual species maps and tables are made openly available for researchers and managers to access, as well as an ensemble of models involving all species to allow more generalised remarks on Australia's overall species movements through time.
