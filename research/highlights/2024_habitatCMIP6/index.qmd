::: {.paper-main-column}
Climate shifts can change where a species might prefer to live. With knowledge on how this might play out, management decisions on where to allocate resources and efforts become more informed and, likely, more effective in preserving biodiversity. It is a nuanced phenomenon though, and climate isn’t something that can be considered alone in determining a changing species distribution. Climate functions in tandem with other finer scale factors to determine livability, as far down to soil characteristics, to larger habitat quality – and has the capacity to change them too. 

This paper uses species occurrence data from the Atlas of Living Australia and combines them with environmental and climatic data to predict possible large-scale habitat preference changes under different climate scenarios. Individual species maps and tabled data are made openly available for researchers and managers to access, as well as an ensemble of species to make general remarks on Australia's overall species movements through time. 

Substantial changes in distributions for many species are found. The combined analysis points species generally to be moving away from coastal regions, with the exception of south and south-west Australia. Adelaide and surrounding central areas have the highest habitat suitability for the over 10,000 combined species included in the study.
